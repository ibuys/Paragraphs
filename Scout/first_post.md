Welcome to Paragraphs!


Thank you for choosing Paragraphs, the desktop blogging app with style! 

This is your first post, created to give you a good feel for how Paragraphs works, and what you can do with it. 

Paragraphs lets you write in plain text, but really shines when using [Markdown][1] , a syntax built for writers on the web written by John Gruber.

>Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

Using markdown lets us make writing easier. For example, dragging and dropping an image into the text editor creates a link like this: ![](media/coffee.png). Clicking on the highlighted text will show a preview of the image, but you can also press Command-Shift-M to view the media manager. All images that have been dragged into Paragraphs will be in the media manager,  if you'd like to reuse one, just double-click it to insert it into the text editor. 

Paragraphs lets you add emphasis to your writing with *italic*, or **Bold** text. 

You can add headers to your writing like this:

# Large Heading #

## Smaller Heading ##

###One Step Smaller  Heading ###

Making lists is also easy:

- First Item
- Second Item
- Third Item

To see how your writing will look when published to the web, choose "View", and then "Preview Post" from the menu bar, or just press Command-Shift-P. The preview pulls the design from the theme, so what you see is what will be published. 

Speaking of themes, Paragraphs supports development of third party themes, and ships with a few of our own. To see which themes are installed, press "Command + ," to open the Preferences panel, and choose the second tab. 

There's a lot more to Paragraphs, so feel free to explore, or just start writing. When you are ready, choose "Publish" from the File menu and Paragraphs will export your site to a folder, ready to be uploaded to a web server.  I hope you enjoy using Paragraphs as much as I do, and thanks again.
